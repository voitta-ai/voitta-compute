"""ask_user_question — put structured questions to the human and wait.

One registry tool, so every brain gets it: the API-key loops dispatch it
inline in the Chainlit turn task, and the subscription brain reaches it as
``mcp__voitta__ask_user_question`` over the in-process bridge.

Why a Voitta tool and not the engine's own ``AskUserQuestion``: the headless
engine simply does not offer that tool (it is an interactive-TUI feature), so
nothing on our side — not ``can_use_tool``, not a PreToolUse hook — can ever
intercept it. The question card in the frontend (``QuestionCard.tsx``, matched
on ``CustomElement(name="AskUserQuestion")``) predates this and is unchanged;
only the way it gets invoked moved.

Safety properties, and what actually enforces each:

* **Only the main agent asks.** Not enforced here — a tool handler receives no
  caller identity, so it cannot be. It holds because the subscription brain
  withholds ``Agent``/``Workflow`` structurally (``_DISALLOWED_ENGINE_TOOLS``
  in runtime.py) and the API-key loop has no subagents at all: no child
  context exists to call this from.
* **One question at a time per session.** Enforced here (``_in_flight``). A
  concurrent call — parallel tool use, or a fan-out that slipped through —
  fails fast instead of stacking prompts.
* **No user, no question.** Server mode and background jobs have no Chainlit
  context; the call fails with an instruction not to ask, never hangs.
* **Waiting cannot be mistaken for an answer.** A timeout or dismissal comes
  back as ``answered: false`` with a reason. The model is told not to assume.
* **The wait cannot be killed by the turn ceiling.** The subscription brain's
  600 s turn timeout is pushed out while a question is pending and restored
  after, on every exit path.
