"""Anthropic adapter.

The normalised types already use Anthropic's block shape, so this is
mostly a pass-through. We pin the official endpoint explicitly because
the process may be launched from a shell where ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` is
set to a proxy (e.g. Claude Code's local relay), which would reject
user-supplied API keys with a 401.

Defence in depth:

  1. ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` is popped from ``os.environ`` at import time
     so no code path on the server side can read it.
  2. ``base_url=ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` is still passed explicitly to the
     client constructor — the SDK respects this regardless of env state.

    We deliberately use the raw streaming API (``.create(stream=True)``)
    rather than the higher-level ``.stream()`` helper. The helper
    accumulates each tool_use's partial JSON buffer on every delta and
    calls ``jiter.from_json(buf, partial_mode=True)`` — which raises
    ``ValueError: expected value at line 1 column N`` whenever the
    model's tool args briefly contain non-JSON characters
    (e.g. ``{"folder": x`` before the value start lands). That blows
    up the entire async-for iteration mid-message even though we don't
    need the SDK's accumulation in the first place — chat.py already
    accumulates ``args_buf`` itself and parses on ``content_block_stop``.
    Going through the raw iterator sidesteps the failure mode entirely.
