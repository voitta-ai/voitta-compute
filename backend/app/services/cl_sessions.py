"""Per-session metadata registry — feeds the MCP debugging endpoint.

Chainlit's own ``WebsocketSession`` registry tracks sockets + ids but
doesn't surface what *page* each session is on, what its user-agent
is, or when we last heard from it. We keep a parallel dict keyed by
``session_id`` and populate it from ``@cl.on_chat_start`` /
``@cl.on_window_message`` so the tray's "list sessions" view (and the
MCP ``mcp_sessions`` tool) can show meaningful debugging info.

Stays in sync with Chainlit's lifecycle:
* ``record_chat_start`` is called from ``@cl.on_chat_start`` and seeds
  user_agent / created_at.
* ``record_host`` is called from ``@cl.on_window_message`` when the
  bookmarklet posts ``host:<host>`` after mount.
* Sessions are dropped lazily: a session shows up as "stale" if its
  id is no longer in ``chainlit.session.ws_sessions_id``.
