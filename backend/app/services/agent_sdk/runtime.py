"""Drive one Claude Agent SDK turn and map its events to Chainlit primitives.

Each user turn is a single ``query()`` call against the Claude Code engine.
Multi-turn continuity is ``resume=<session_id>`` (continue-only — no fork),
which keeps the engine's session id stable so the history dropdown can list
and reopen it. The new/continued session id is captured from the terminal
``ResultMessage`` and returned to the caller, which stamps it on the session
and thread for the next turn.

Tools are the registry suite, bridged in-process (see :mod:`.bridge`), plus a
small allowlist of engine built-ins — ``Bash``, ``Read``, ``WebSearch`` and
``WebFetch`` (see ``_ALLOWED_ENGINE_TOOLS``). The engine's mutating native tools
(``Write``/``Edit``/``NotebookEdit``/…) are denied by ``can_use_tool``, so the
Voitta tools stay the primary surface for anything that changes state.

# it run a command in its pinned per-user workspace cwd is better UX than a hard
# refusal. Read is enabled because it is the engine's only way to VIEW images —
# chat attachments are persisted to the project's uploads tree and handed over
# as file paths (see chainlit_app._persist_attachments_for_engine); with Bash
# already allowed, Read grants no filesystem access Bash didn't have.
# WebSearch and WebFetch are enabled because the engine reaches for them
# constantly — they are how it checks current facts and reads a page the user
# pasted — and the alternative is the model being told mid-turn that a tool it
# can plainly see is "not available in this assistant". Note WebFetch feeds
# fetched page text to the model, so a hostile page is untrusted input; the
# engine's own prompting treats it that way. The remaining native tools
# (Write/Edit/NotebookEdit/…) stay denied, so the Voitta MCP tools remain the
# primary surface for anything that mutates state.
#
# Everything listed here is spliced into ``allowed_tools``, which AUTO-APPROVES
# it: the SDK never consults ``can_use_tool`` for a tool allowed outright (it
# warns about this — CanUseToolShadowedWarning). So this tuple is the real

#     propagates into subagents; the callback does not.
#   * Anything in ``allowed_tools`` is auto-approved and skips the callback.
#
# So: mutating filesystem tools, ``Artifact`` (publishes to the web), and the
# whole fan-out surface. Blocking fan-out is also what makes "only the main
# agent can ask the user a question" a guarantee rather than a hope — the
# MCP tool handler receives no caller identity, so the only way to be sure no
# subagent asks is for no subagent to exist. (When ``Agent`` alone was blocked
