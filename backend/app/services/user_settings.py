"""Backend-stored user settings (LLM API keys, provider, model, caps).

Migrated out of the browser's localStorage so settings persist across
host origins (the bookmarklet is the same widget regardless of which
site you click it on, but ``localStorage`` is partitioned per origin —
keys saved on one host would be invisible on another). The new home is
a JSON blob in the user's XDG config dir, owned by the running user
(``0600``).

Stays on the host machine. The backend already binds to ``127.0.0.1``,
so this file is no more reachable from the network than the LLM-key
state in localStorage was. Trade-off accepted: keys end up in plain
text on disk.

The blob is opaque to this module — we don't validate provider IDs,
model names, etc. Validation lives in the frontend (``lib/settings.ts``)
and is reapplied on every read there. Server-side, we only enforce
that the blob is a JSON object.
